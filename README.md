# imbalance_Dataset_Classification:
Imbalanced classification refers to a classification predictive modeling problem where the number of examples in the training dataset for each class label is not balanced. That is, where the class distribution is not equal or close to equal, and is instead biased or skewed
# Description:
In this project we analyse the citizen data and predict the income_level of citizen based on many features. This project is brushup your feature selection,extraction skills.And data visualization  will guide you which model we need to choose for classification. Its all about hit and try.
# Goals and Pre-requisite of Project:
estimate the income_level of citizen and visualize with other features. visualization is done by matplot,seaborn library and feature selection is done by wrapper method ols model is very helpful in imbalance dataset. Gretl application is used to find the right features for predict income level of many citizen and linear classification algorithm like :- Naive bayes and LogisticRegression is used.
